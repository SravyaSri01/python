Basic Operators in python:
→ Python has several categories of basic operators used to perform operations on variables and values. 
→ These include arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, identity, membership, and bitwise operators.

1. Arithmetic Operators:
• Used for basic mathematical operations.

Operator	       Description	           Example
+	               Addition	               a + b
-	               Subtraction	           a - b
*	               Multiplication	         a * b
/	               Division	               a / b
//	             Floor Division	         a // b
%	               Modulus (remainder)	   a % b
**	             Exponentiation	         a ** b

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators:
• Used to compare values.

Operator	      Description	                  Example
==	            Equal to	                    a == b
!=	            Not equal to	                a != b
>	              Greater than	                a > b
<	              Less than	                    a < b
>=	            Greater than or equal to	    a >= b
<=	            Less than or equal to	        a <= b

3.Assignment Operators:
• Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	        Description	                Example
=	                Assign	                    a = b
+=	              Add and assign	            a += b
-=	              Subtract and assign	        a -= b
*=	              Multiply and assign	        a *= b
/=	              Divide and assign	          a /= b
//=	              Floor divide and assign	    a //= b
%=	              Modulus and assign	        a %= b
**=	              Exponent and assign	        a **= b

4. Logical Operators:
• Used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	      Description	                  Example
and	            True if both are true	        a > 1 and b < 5
or	            True if at least one true	    a > 1 or b < 5
not	            Reverse the result	          not(a > 1)

5. Bitwise Operators:
• Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

Operator	       Description	         Example
&	               AND	                 a & b
|                OR                    a|b
^	               XOR	                 a ^ b
~	               NOT (bitwise)	       ~a
<<	             Left shift	           a << 2
>>	             Right shift	         a >> 2

6. Membership Operators:
• Test for membership in a sequence (like lists, strings, etc.)

Operator	    Description	                    Example
in	          True if value is found	        'a' in 'cat'
not in	      True if not found	              'x' not in 'cat'

7. Identity Operators:
• Compare memory locations.

Operator	      Description	                  Example
is	            True if same object	          a is b
is not	        True if not same object	      a is not b
